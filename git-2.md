### Definition of Version Control system *VCS* 
*is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version*

### Centralized Version Control Sustem *CVCS*
*This system allowed programmers to have more knowledge of team members’ activities with certain files, and gave administrators much more control over divvying up revision privileges **(by eliminating the need to involve all local databases)***

### Distributed Version Control system *DVCS*
*This system allows clients to create mirrored repositories. These data backups can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information*

*Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it*
